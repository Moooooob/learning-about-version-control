# Learning about Version Control
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

The thing I like most about version control is that you can always develop confidently without worrying about breaking things.

The most challenging thing I found is when other collaborators don't have good manner of code submitting and there is no code squash enabled, resolving code conflicts could be really annoying.
